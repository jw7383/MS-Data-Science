The Center was established in 2013 to advance NYU’s goal of creating a world-leading Data Science training and research facility, and arming researchers and professionals with the tools to harness the power of Big Data. Today, CDS counts 16 jointly appointed interdisciplinary faculty housed on two floors of our magnificent 60 5th Avenue building, one of New York City’s historic properties. It is home to a top-ranked MS in Data Science program, one of the first PhD programs in Data Science, and a new undergraduate program in Data Science, as well as a lively Fellow and Postdoctoral program. It has over 60 associate and affiliate faculty from 25 departments in 9 schools and units. With cross-disciplinary research and innovative educational programs, CDS is shaping the new field of Data Science.\""
